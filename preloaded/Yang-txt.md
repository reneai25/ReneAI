3. Identify diversion facilities where the construction and demolition waste material collected will be
taken.

4. Identify construction methods employed to reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste
generated.

5. Specify that the amount of construction and demolition waste materials diverted shall be calculated
by weight or volume, but not by both.

Contractor 4.408.3 WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. Utilize a waste management company, approved by the
enforcing agency, which can provide verifiable documentation that the percentage of construction and
demolition waste material diverted from the landfill complies with Section 4.408.1.

lbs./sq.ft. of the building area shall meet the minimum 65% construction waste reduction requirement in
Section 4.408.1

Contractor 4.408.4.1 WASTE STREAM REDUCTION ALTERNATIVE. Projects that generate a total combined
weight of construction and demolition waste disposed of in landfills, which do not exceed 2 pounds

1. Directions to the owner or occupant that the manual shall remain with the building throughout the
life cycle of the structure.

2. Operation and maintenance instructions for the following:

a. Equipment and appliances, including water-saving devices and systems, HVAC systems,
photovoltaic systems, electric vehicle chargers, water-heating systems and other major
appliances and equipment.

b. Roof and yard drainage, including gutters and downspouts.

c. Space conditioning systems, including condensers and air filters.

d. Landscape irrigation systems.

e. Water reuse systems.

3. Information from local utility, water and waste recovery providers on methods to further reduce
resource consumption, including recycle programs and locations.

4. Public transportation and/or carpool options available in the area.

5. Educational material on the positive impacts of an interior relative humidity between 30-60 percent
and what methods an occupant may use to maintain the relative humidity level in that range.

6. Information about water-conserving landscape and irrigation design and controllers which conserve
water.

7. Instructions for maintaining gutters and downspouts and the importance of diverting water at least 5
feet away from the foundation.

8. Information on required routine maintenance measures, including, but not limited to, caulking,
painting, grading around the building, etc.

9. Information about state solar energy and incentive programs available.
